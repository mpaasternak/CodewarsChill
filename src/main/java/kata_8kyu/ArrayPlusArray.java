I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements.
I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArrayPlusArray {
    public static int arrayPlusArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2){
        return Arrays.stream(arr1).sum() + Arrays.stream(arr2).sum();
    }

}
